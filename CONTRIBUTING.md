## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome many types of contributions:

-   **Bug fixes**: Fix issues reported in the issue tracker
-   **New features**: Add new functionality (please discuss in an issue first)
-   **Documentation**: Improve README, code comments, or create examples
-   **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
-   **Code quality**: Refactoring, optimization, or style improvements

### Before You Start

For major changes:

1. **Open an issue** first to discuss what you would like to change
2. Wait for feedback from maintainers
3. Once approved, create your pull request

For minor changes (typos, small bugs, documentation):

-   Feel free to submit a PR directly

## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

We follow Laravel and PSR-12 coding standards:

-   Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs)
-   Follow **PSR-12** naming conventions
-   Use **type hints** for parameters and return types
-   Write **descriptive variable and method names**
-   Keep methods **focused and single-purpose**

### Code Style

This project uses **Laravel Pint** for automatic code formatting:

```bash
composer format
```

**Always run Pint before committing** to ensure consistent code style.

### PHPStan

We use PHPStan for static analysis to catch potential bugs:

```bash
composer analyse
```

Ensure your code passes PHPStan analysis before submitting a PR.

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

Run the full test suite:

```bash
composer test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
composer test-coverage
```

Run specific test files:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest tests/ChatEngineTest.php
```

Run tests by filter:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --filter=mutual
```

### Writing Tests

-   **All new features** must include tests
-   **Bug fixes** should include a test that fails before the fix
-   Use **descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
-   Follow the existing test structure and conventions
-   Aim for **high test coverage** (we maintain comprehensive coverage)

### Test Structure

```php
it('describes what the test does in plain English', function () {
    // Arrange: Set up test data
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    $team = Team::factory()->create();

    // Act: Perform the action being tested
    $user->follow($team);

    // Assert: Verify the expected outcome
    expect($user->isFollowing($team))->toBeTrue();
});
```

### Test Categories

Tests are organized into categories:

-   **ChatEngineTest.php**: Basic follow/unfollow operations
-   **FollowersQueryTest.php**: Follower query methods
-   **FollowingsQueryTest.php**: Following query methods
-   **MutualTest.php**: Mutual relationships
-   **PolymorphicTest.php**: Polymorphic relationships
-   **ScopesTest.php**: Query scopes
-   **EdgeCasesTest.php**: Edge cases and error handling
-   **ConfigTest.php**: Configuration options

Add your tests to the appropriate file or create a new category if needed.

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for clear and standardized commit messages:

<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

-   `feat:` - A new feature
-   `fix:` - A bug fix
-   `docs:` - Documentation only changes
-   `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
-   `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
-   `test:` - Adding or updating tests
-   `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.
-   `perf:` - Performance improvements

**Example:**

```
feat(mutual): add mutual followers query method

**Guidelines:**

-   Keep the subject line under 72 characters
